● Based on my knowledge, AWS Amplify Hosting does support git subtrees, but with
  some considerations:

  Yes, it works - Amplify can build and deploy from repositories that use git
  subtrees since subtrees are part of the main repository's history (unlike
  submodules which are separate references).

  Key points:

  1. Subtree content is included - When Amplify clones your repo, subtree
  directories are already present in the repo, so no special configuration is
  needed to fetch them.
  2. Build settings - You may need to adjust your amplify.yml if your app root is
  within a subtree directory:
  version: 1
  appRoot: path/to/subtree
  frontend:
    phases:
      build:
        commands:
          - npm install
          - npm run build
  3. Monorepo settings - If using subtrees in a monorepo setup, you can configure
  Amplify to only trigger builds when files in specific paths change.

  Potential gotchas:
  - Build triggers happen on any push to the branch, regardless of which subtree
  changed
  - If you need path-based filtering for builds, configure it in Amplify's "Build
  settings" > "Monorepo" options

  Would you like more specific information about configuring Amplify with a
  particular subtree setup?

> Yes, I have one repo that lives here
  /mnt/c/Users/karlw/Documents/Dev/karlwallace.com and I want the repo that
  lives here /mnt/c/Users/karlw/Documents/Dev/finances to be a sub tree

● Here's how to add the finances repo as a subtree in your karlwallace.com repo:

  Setup Steps

  1. Navigate to your main repo:
  cd /mnt/c/Users/karlw/Documents/Dev/karlwallace.com

  2. Add the finances repo as a remote:
  git remote add finances https://github.com/Mhoram/mortgage-calc.git
  (Replace with your actual remote URL if different)

  3. Add the subtree:
  git subtree add --prefix=finances finances main --squash

  This creates a finances/ directory in karlwallace.com containing the finances
  repo content.

  Ongoing Workflow

  Pull updates from finances repo:
  git subtree pull --prefix=finances finances main --squash

  Push changes back to finances repo (if you edit files in the subtree):
  git subtree push --prefix=finances finances main

  AWS Amplify Configuration

  In your karlwallace.com Amplify app, if the finances calculator should be at
  /finances:
  - The files will already be in the finances/ directory
  - No special Amplify config needed since subtree content is part of your main
  repo

  If finances should be a separate Amplify app, you can set up a second Amplify app
   pointing to the same repo with appRoot: finances in the build settings.
